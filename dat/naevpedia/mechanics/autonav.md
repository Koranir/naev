# Autonav

Your ship is equipped with an Automatic Navigation system, usually abbreviated as Autonav.
This system allows your ship to automatically go to target locations, land on planets, follow ships, and even fly along routes to far away systems.

Autonav can be triggered several different ways, but the main way is by opening the overlay map with the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("overlay").."#0" %> key, and then right-clicking to go to a location.
You can also double-click on a space object such as a planet to land on it, double-click on a jump point to use it, or right-click on a selected pilot to automatically follow them.

You can also activate autonav directly from the [star map](mechanics/map) by selecting a system and clicking on the #bAutonav#0 button to go to it.

## Settings

Autonav settings can be modified from the #binformation window#0 that you can open with the <%= "#b"..naev.keyGet("info").."#0" %> key.
Afterwards, click on the #bsettings#0 button from the main tab.

You can control many aspects of the behaviour, such as whether or not you follow pilots that jump or land, whether or not you move along the patrol lanes, or whether you match speed with the slowest ship in your fleet, among other options.
