## Notes

### The engines paradox

As contribution to speed depends on eml, and as engines pri contribution is better, a primary engine with high eml will impose its (fast) pace.

As a consequence, heavy engines in primary may result in faster ships.

Conversely, putting a low eml in pri engine and high eml in sec will always result in a poor combination, don't do that !
