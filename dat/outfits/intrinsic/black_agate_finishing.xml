  <description>For the most demanding famous pirates, the Black Agate Finishing gives a luxurious coat to any ship, while not only being cosmetic, but having some functional properties. Although the maker claims that it is made from crushed virgin black agates mined from the interior of the gas giant Qorel I, it is likely it is made from minerals extracted from the asteroid belt or stolen goods. Popular as a status symbol among those pirates that can afford it.
