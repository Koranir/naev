  <description>Chloe I is covered in a dense layer of vegetation, likely brought here by a colonizer or visitor many cycles ago. The atmosphere contains large amounts of oxygen which make it very inflammable and unstable, making planetary-scale conflagrations a not entirely rare phenomena. However, the vegetation has adapted and competes to quickly regrow from the ashes of their predecessors.</description>
