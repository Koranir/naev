  <description>Although the outter few kilometers of Nougat II are mainly frozen solid, the core of the planet is still active and very hot. However, most of the planetary mass is a porous ceramic mass that acts as a strong insulator, leading to such drastic temperature differences between the interior and exterior.</description>
